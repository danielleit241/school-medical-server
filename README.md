    ```

3. **Configure the database connection**
    - Edit `appsettings.json` (in the API or Infrastructure project) and update the `ConnectionStrings` section with your SQL Server details.

4. **Apply database migrations**
    ```bash
    dotnet ef database update
    ```
    > If no migrations exist yet, create an initial migration:

6. **Test the API**
    - Use Swagger UI (usually at `/swagger`) or Postman to interact with endpoints.
